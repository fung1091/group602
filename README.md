### Research Interest 
We are interested in financial analysis in machine learning. In this project, we will pick the dataset into different method of machine learning as our study target. So this project will help us deep understanding about machine learning using in finance sector.

### Data Collection
We will collect data in two different ways:
1) Download history stock price from Yahoo Finance, Quandl function and CSV using, and study their stabilibility.
2) Extract data information by python
   We are aim to extract the desired data information from web source into machine learning analysis.

### Data Analysis Methods
1. Data Visualization
   We will visualize the data by using Matplotlib library to conduct analysis at certain stock price change over time and make comparsion.
2. Statistical Analysis
   We will use SciPy library to compare recent data with the past to check if there is a significant change in financial data.
3. Predictive analysis
   We want to predict the future price for specific stock based on the history stock price data and we will make a prediction thought logistic regression training, multiple regression, SVM and Support Vector Regression.

### Project Goals
1. We will gain more experience with data analysis in Python and get familiar to various python modules, such as Numpy, Pandas, SciPy and Matplotlib. 
2. And We can have more idea in using machine learning method.
